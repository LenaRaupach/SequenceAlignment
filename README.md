**Needleman-Wunsch Alignment in Rust**
A Rust implementation of the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment in bioinformatics.
This project provides a simple yet efficient way to compare and align DNA, RNA, or protein sequences using dynamic programming.

Features
- Implements classical Needleman–Wunsch algorithm
- Configurable scoring for match, mismatch, and gap penalties
- Clean and minimal Rust codebase with detailed comments
- Supports customizable sequences through command-line or direct invocation
- Easy to integrate into larger bioinformatics pipelines
